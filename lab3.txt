As a manufacturer, I want to be able to add my brewery/winery/distillery 
to the app so that customers can find my establishment.
   -- NOTE: I think this is an unnecessary option. We are now getting the up to date list of licensed establishments, so there should be no one legal off the list.
   -- NOTE 2: I need help with this one if we are using it. It seems
 super complicated and my acceptance criteria would all end up as big 
user stories with verification and stuff =(.
   -- Create a manufacturer account. 

As a manufacturer, I want to be able to add a description or website link
to the app so I can give my customers more information about my business.

given that we are expecting to use google or facebook or twitter logins 
as our accounts so we don?t need to know too much about it.
