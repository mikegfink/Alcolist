Procedures for team LAMchop:

1. If you make changes to any files, CREATE A NEW BRANCH FIRST.
2. Master branch of files should be updated at least collectively at twice weekly meetings, simple merges to master may be made daily.
3. Always communicate, if you need help, ask. If you need more work, ask. If Mike 
   is too pushy, ask (I mean... yell at him - he doesn't mind).
